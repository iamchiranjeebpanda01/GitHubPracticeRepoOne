# GitHubPracticeRepoOne

Welcome to GitHubPracticeRepoOne, a repository that showcases my practiced version of GitHub Actions in conjunction with the course "GitHub Actions - The Complete Guide" from Udemy.

## Workflows

### 1. Lint, Test, and Deploy Workflow

This workflow is triggered automatically on a "push" event to the repository. 

### 2. Output Event Details Workflow

This workflow is triggered whenever an "issues" event occurs in your repository. It captures event details and provides information about the issue event that triggered it.

## Prerequisites

Before using these GitHub Actions workflows, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- A GitHub account.
- A GitHub repository where you plan to implement these actions.
- A basic understanding of GitHub Actions.
